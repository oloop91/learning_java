Sedgewick and Wayne - Guiding principles

Beware of programs that might require exponential time.

Whenever you can clearly separate tasks within programs, you should do so.

whenever you can clearly separate data and associated tasks within a computation, you should do so.

A data type is a set of values and a set of operations defined on those values.

The guiding principle in API design is to provide to clients the methods they need and no others

Mastering recursion is essential to understanding and exploiting computation and in understanding the role of computational models in studying natural phenomena.

Q. Which should I prefer, recursion or iteration?
A. Whichever leads to the simpler, more easily understood, or more efficient code.

Easily understandable code is an integral part of problem solving using computers

The first thing that we strive for when creating a program is an understanding
of the types of data that we will need. Developing this understanding is a design
activity.

You should consider writing every program as though you will need to reuse the code somedayâ€”not because you know that you will reuse that code, but because you are quite likely to want to reuse some of your code and you cannot know which code you will need.

Expect Bugs

Keep Modules Small - You can focus attention on at most a few dozen lines of code
at a time, so you may as well break your code into small modules as you write it.

Limit Interaction

Develop Code Incrementally

Solve an easier problem

Consider a recursive solution  

Build tools when appropriate

Reuse Software when possible
